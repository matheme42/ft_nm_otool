## Foreword
This first project marks the beginning my training to become de software engineer

## Objectives
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C
projects.

## contents
own library is split on 3 parts
. libc function like [memset | memmove | strchr | ...]
. additionnal function like [ft_str_clr | ft_strnew | ft_strmap | ...]
. and function for manipulate lists more easilly
